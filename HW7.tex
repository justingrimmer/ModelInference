\maketitle

\noindent Assigned: 5/19/2016\\
Due: 6/2/2016\\

\noindent In this problem set we're going to use machine learning to predict student's drinking habits.  The data come from a public health study of Portugese students.  You can read more about the variables (and their interpretation) here: \\

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/STUDENT+ALCOHOL+CONSUMPTION\# . 

\noindent We're going to model the sum of weekday and weekend drinking activity.    \\

\noindent The data are stored in {\tt StudentDrinking.RData} on canvas.  The dependent variable is, {\tt alcohol}, which is a measure of alcohol consumption.  The bigger {\tt alcohol} is, the more students drink.  The covariates are stored in {\tt X}.  

\section{Comparing Coefficients from OLS, LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net}

We first want to explore the behavior of OLS, LASSO, and Ridge applied to the data.  

\begin{itemize}
\item[i)] Fit a linear regression of alcohol on the covariates in the included data
\item[ii)] Using {\tt cv.glmnet} fit a LASSO regression of alcohol on the covariates
\item[iii)] Using {\tt cv.glmnet} fit a Ridge regression of alcohol on the covariates
\item[iv)] Using {\tt cv.glmnet} fit an elastic-net regression of alcohol on the covariates, with $\alpha = 0.5$.  Explain what $\alpha = 0.5$ implies about the model you're fitting.  
\item[v)] Using your models from (i-iv) let's examine the behavior of the coefficient on {\tt male} as $\lambda$ increases
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] Suppose {\tt glmnet.obj} contains the results from applying {\tt cv.glmnet}.  To obtain the coefficient values for the sequence of $\lambda$ values tested in {\tt cv.glmnet}, we use the coefficient function {\tt coef(glmnet.obj, s = glmnet.obj\$lambda)}.  Use this function to obtain a matrix of coefficients for the models used in (ii-iv).  
\item[b)] Using the matrix for each method, plot the coefficient on {\tt male} against the value of $\lambda$ from the models in ii-iv.  Include the coefficient from OLS as a flat line.  What do you notice as $\lambda$ increases?  
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\section{Cross-Validation, Super Learning and Ensembles}

We're going to assess the performance of five models, an unweighted average, and a super-learning average of the methods.

\begin{itemize}
\item[i)] First, set the first 20 rows to the side for use as the validation set.
\item[ii)] We'll first estimate the (unconstrained) super learner weights.  
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] On the training data (all but the first 20 rows) perform ten fold cross validation, including (1) linear regression, (2) LASSO, (3) Ridge, (4) Elastic-Net, and (5) Random Forest.  Obtain 5 predictions for each observation in the training set, one from each observation
\item[b)] Regress the dependent variable on the out of sample prediction, (without including an intercept).
\item[c)] Store those weights as $\boldsymbol{w}$
\end{itemize}
\item[iii)] Now, fit all 5 models from (ii)-(a) to the entire training data set and predict the drinking level from the vallidation set (the data put off to the side).
\item[iv)]   Obtain two ensemble predictions.  
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] Take the unweighted average of the predictions from the methods
\item[b)] Take the weighted average, using the weights $\boldsymbol{w}$.
\end{itemize}
\item[v)] You should have 7 predictions. Store those in a matrix and report the correlation between the predictions
\item[vi)] Using the average absolute difference as a loss function assess the performance of each method.  Which method performs best?  Which performs the worst? 

\noindent The average absolute difference for method $k$ is defined as 
\begin{eqnarray}
L(\boldsymbol{Y}, \widehat{\boldsymbol{Y}}_{k}) & = & \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{validation}}} \frac{|Y_{i} - \widehat{Y}_{ik}| }{ N_{\text{validation}} }\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
where $N_{\text{validation}}$ refers to the number of observations in the validation set $\widehat{\boldsymbol{Y}}_{k}$ refers to the predictions from the $k^{\text{th}}$ method, 


\end{itemize}
